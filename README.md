# Mario-Reinforcement-Learning
A reinforcement learning project to create an agent that can play Super Mario Bros.

Hello! This is a project where I am using the Deep Q Learning Algorithm [1] to train an agent to Super Mario Bros. 
I was only able to start this project by looking at the following materials:

As of right now the project is not finished, there is still a lot for me to do. I will continue to update this repo as I work on this project.
